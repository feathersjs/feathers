# Scaling

Depending on your requirements, your feathers application may need to provide high availability. Feathers is designed to scale.

The types of transports used in a feathers application will impact the scaling configuration. For example, a feathers app that uses the `feathers-rest` adapter exclusively will require less scaling configuration because HTTP is a stateless protocol. If using websockets (a stateful protocol) through the `feathers-socketio` or `feathers-primus` adapters, configuration may be more complex to ensure websockets work properly.

## Horizontal Scaling

Scaling horizontally refers to either:

- setting up a [cluster](https://nodejs.org/api/cluster.html), or
- adding more machines to support your application

To achieve high availability, varying combinations of both strategies may be used.

## Cluster configuration

[Cluster](https://nodejs.org/api/cluster.html) support is built into core NodeJS. Since NodeJS is single threaded, clustering allows you to easily distribute application requests among multiple child processes (and multiple threads). Clustering is a good choice when running feathers in a multi-core environment.

Below is an example of adding clustering to feathers with the `feathers-socketio` provider. By default, websocket connections begin via a handshake of multiple HTTP requests and are upgraded to the websocket protocol. However, when clustering is enabled, the same worker will not process all HTTP requests for a handshake, leading to HTTP 400 errors. To ensure a successful handshake, force a single worker to process the handshake by disabling the http transport and exclusively using the `websocket` transport.

```js
import cluster from 'cluster';
import feathers from '@feathersjs/feathers';
import socketio from '@feathersjs/socketio';

const CLUSTER_COUNT = 4;

if (cluster.isMaster) {
  for (let i = 0; i < CLUSTER_COUNT; i++) {
    cluster.fork();
  }
} else {
  const app = feathers();
  // ensure the same worker handles websocket connections
  app.configure(socketio({
    transports: ['websocket']
  }));
  app.listen(4000);
}
```

In your feathers client code, limit the socket.io-client to the `websocket` transport and disable `upgrade`.

```js
import feathers from '@feathersjs/client';
import socketio from '@feathersjs/socketio-client';
import io from 'socket.io-client';

const app = feathers()
  .configure(socketio(
    io('http://api.feathersjs.com', {
      transports: ['websocket'],
      upgrade: false
    })
  ));
```
## Multiple instances
When running multiple instances of your Feathers application (e.g. on several Heroku Dynos), service events (created, updated, patched, removed and any custom defined events) do not get propagated to other instances for such cases you may want to use: https://github.com/feathersjs-ecosystem/feathers-sync

Which will use a messaging mechanism to propagate all events to all application instances like redis or RabbitMQ
