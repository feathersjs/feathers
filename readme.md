Feathers is a lightweight web-framework for creating real-time applications and REST APIs using JavaScript or TypeScript.

Feathers can interact with any backend technology, supports over a dozen databases and works with any frontend technology like React, VueJS, Angular, React Native, Android or iOS.

## Getting started

You can build your first real-time and REST API in just 4 commands:

```bash
$ npm install -g @feathersjs/cli
$ mkdir my-new-app
$ cd my-new-app/
$ feathers generate app
$ npm start
```
